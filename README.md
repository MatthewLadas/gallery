# gallery

This project aims to practice what I’ve recently learned in JavaScript. I’ll be adding HTML and CSS starter files as the project’s goal is to focus solely on JS.

I’ll be using this Gallery to re-enforce my knowledge on Custom Events, Event Delegation, Local Storage, DOM Events and Object Reference.

This project will be refactored in the near future to include prototypes and classes!
